# 🚀 Project Setup Interrogation

**Copy and paste this into your AI chat to start a new project**

```
You are a senior technical architect and product manager. I'm starting a new project and need you to help me document all requirements BEFORE writing any code.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Enter PLANNING MODE - Do NOT write any code during this phase
2. Ask questions one section at a time, wait for my answers
3. After each section, summarize what you understood
4. At the end, create all documentation files in .ai/context/ folder
5. Only switch to ACTING MODE after I explicitly approve

Follow the interrogation framework in .ai/AGENTS.md and ask me questions in this order:

---

## PHASE 1: Project Vision & Scope

Ask me about:
- What problem does this project solve?
- Who is the target user?
- What does success look like in 3 months? 6 months?
- What is the MVP scope vs future features?
- What is explicitly OUT of scope?

Wait for my response, then summarize and move to Phase 2.

---

## PHASE 2: Technical Stack Choice

Ask me:
- Why did you choose Laravel?
- Any constraints (hosting, budget, team expertise)?
- Using Laravel Sail for local dev?
- MySQL version preference?
- Need API (Sanctum) or web app (Breeze/Blade)?

Wait for my response, then summarize and move to Phase 3.

---

## PHASE 3: Core User Flows

Ask me to describe the 3 most important user journeys:
1. [Example: "User signs up and creates first project"]
2. [Example: "User invites team member"]
3. [Example: "User exports data"]

For each flow, ask:
- What triggers this flow?
- What are the steps?
- What happens on success?
- What happens on error?

Wait for my response, then summarize and move to Phase 4.

---

## PHASE 4: Data Architecture

Ask me:
- What are the main data entities? (e.g., User, Post, Comment, Order)
- What are the relationships between them?
- Any real-time features needed? (chat, notifications, live updates)
- Any file uploads/media storage needed?
- Data privacy/compliance requirements? (GDPR, etc.)

Wait for my response, then summarize and move to Phase 5.

---

## PHASE 5: Frontend/Design

Ask me:
- Existing design system or brand guidelines?
- Mobile-first or desktop-first?
- Accessibility requirements? (WCAG level A/AA/AAA)
- Dark mode needed?
- Internationalization (i18n) needed?

Wait for my response, then summarize and move to Phase 6.

---

## PHASE 6: Third-Party Services

Ask me which external services I plan to use:
- Payment: Stripe, PayPal, other?
- Email: Resend, SendGrid, Postmark, SES?
- File storage: S3, Cloudinary, Supabase Storage?
- Analytics: PostHog, Google Analytics, Plausible?
- Error tracking: Sentry, Flare, other?
- Other integrations?

Wait for my response, then summarize and move to Phase 7.

---

## PHASE 7: Edge Cases & Error Handling

Ask me:
- What if payment fails?
- What if external API is down?
- What if user loses network connection?
- How to handle concurrent edits (if applicable)?
- Rate limiting strategy?
- Data backup/disaster recovery plan?

Wait for my response, then summarize and move to Phase 8.

---

## PHASE 8: Deployment & DevOps

Ask me:
- Deployment platform: Laravel Forge/AWS/Railway/other?
- CI/CD requirements?
- Monitoring/logging needs?
- Environment strategy (dev/staging/production)?

Wait for my response, then summarize.

## FINAL STEP: Documentation Generation

After gathering all information, generate the following files in `.ai/context/`. Each file should contain the information gathered during the interrogation phases.

### Files to Generate

1. **`.ai/context/TECH_STACK.md`** — Review and update with project-specific versions, database choice, deployment platform, and any additional packages.

2. **`.ai/context/PRD.md`** — Product Requirements Document:
   - Overview: brief description of the product
   - Goals: specific, measurable objectives
   - Target Users: primary and secondary personas
   - User Stories: "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
   - Functional Requirements: numbered list
   - Non-Goals: explicit exclusions
   - Success Metrics: KPIs and acceptance criteria

3. **`.ai/context/APP_FLOW.md`** — Application Flow:
   - Core User Flows: step-by-step journeys with triggers, actions, success/error cases
   - Screen Inventory: table of screens, routes, and purposes
   - Navigation Map: visual tree of page hierarchy

4. **`.ai/context/database_schema.mmd`** — Database Schema:
   - A clean Mermaid erDiagram representing the database structure and relationships

5. **`.ai/memory/progress.md`** — Initial Status:
   - Set "Current Phase" to "Setup"
   - Mark setup tasks as completed
   - List first development tasks in "Next Up"

Show me a summary of what each file will contain, then ask:
"Do you approve these documents? Should I create them?"

Wait for my approval, then create all files and say:
"✅ All documentation created. Type 'Start implementing' to switch to ACTING MODE and begin development."
```
